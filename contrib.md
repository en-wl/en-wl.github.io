Suggestions for new words is always welcome but please note that I am
fairly selective about letting new words in that are not in one of my
source lists.  New words entering the lexicon and names of popular
well known products are more likely to be accepted.
Please submit these requests as [issues on
github](https://github.com/en-wl/wordlist/issues), but before
submitting please first use the [this 
tool](http://app.aspell.net/lookup) to check if a word is in the
latest dictionary.

If you are looking for ways to contribute then browsing through the
issues labeled ["Help
Wanted"](https://github.com/en-wl/wordlist/labels/help%20wanted) is a
good way to start.  Pull requests always welcome.

General feedback is also welcome.  Please simply email me directly at
<kevina@gnu.org>.

If you wish for a more public discussion you can also post to the the
<a
href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/wordlist-devel">wordlist-devel</a>
mailing list or if the issue is specific [file an issue](https://github.com/en-wl/wordlist/issues) on GitHub.
